## **üìä Showcasing My Latest Data Analytics Project in Excel! üìà** 

I'm thrilled to share my recent data analytics project, where I utilized Excel to answer key business questions through pivot tables, pivot charts, and powerful data visualizations. This project not only honed my analytical abilities but also demonstrated the impact of data-driven insights on business decisions.

## üîç Project Overview
In this comprehensive project, I followed a structured approach to analyze and visualize data:

### **Understand the Data: Thoroughly examined the dataset to grasp its structure and contents.** ###
### **Clean the Data: Used Power Query to clean and prepare the data for analysis.** ###
### **Insert Calculations and Columns: Calculated important metrics like COGS (cost of goods sold) using Power Query.** ###
### **Modeling the Data: Created new measures and columns to facilitate in-depth analysis.** ###
